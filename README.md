# Quiz Me Up!

**Quiz Me Up!** is a trivia game created for the very first SwiftUI Jam! It features questions from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com) and lots of SwiftUI! We were very excited to be able to improve our SwiftUI skills and software architecture knowledge. There was a lot of experimenting with custom transitions and animations! We had so much fun and the pleasure of spending the weekend with such a great community!
